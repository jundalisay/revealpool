<h4 style="color: crimson; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .9;">What are the Problems with the USD as International Currency?</h4>

<small style="color: black; background-color: whitesmoke; text-align: left; opacity: .8; padding: 15px;">

US Policy **arbitrarily** affects national economies that transact using the US Dollar.  

National currencies are subject to **attack by speculators** who use the US Dollar. 
<!-- Countries are forced to import  do not have control of their economies -->

**External debt** becomes attractive initially, and then becomes dangerous as the currency depreciates.  

Exporters and importers are **immediately affected** by fluctuations

<h4 style="color: darkcyan">Solution: Pool Clearing</h4>

<small>
Banks form a pool that acts as one entity, using a common ledger to clear cross-border local currency transactions for remittances and import/export. 
</small>

<h4 style="color: darkcyan; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .9;">Clearing Funds</h4>

<small style="background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .9; color: black;">

Each bank sets up <b>a clearing fund in local currency</b> which provides liquidity for the pool. 

The fund is used to pay cash directly for remittances and exporters. The fund is filled by cash from micro, small, medium, and large investors who have saved money by using the Pantrypoints system of delayed-barter. This is why Pantrypoints comes before Pool Clearing.

<small style="color: white; background-color: black; opacity: .7; padding: 15px;">

<h4 style="color: darkcyan;">The 'Pool' Way of Foreign Trade</h4>

<h4 style="color: darkcyan; background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .9;">Points Mechanism</h4>

<p style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; opacity: .9;">
1 Point = Price of 1 kg rice
</p>

<p style="background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .9;">
Pool Clearing replaces the USD with the local price of basic rice as the basis of value. 
</p>

<small style="background-color: whitesmoke; opacity: .9;">

Year | Rice per kilo | Peso per USD | Difference
---| --- | --- | ---  
2003 | 21 pesos | 54 pesos | 33
2010 | 27 pesos | 47 pesos | 20
2018 | 32 pesos | 50 pesos | 18
2020 | 35 pesos | 51 pesos | 16
2022 | 38 pesos | 58 pesos | 20


This will create stability in the pool economies, different from the current volatile pricing of stocks and oil.

## Expansion to World Trade

<small>
The points system expands to world trade via Pool Clearing, where national rice price is the basis of currency.

For example, the "pool exchange rates" between Vietnam and the Philippines is below

Year | Current System | Pantrypoints Pool System
--- | --- | --- 
2010 | 1 USD = 40 PHP = 19,000 VND | 1 USD = 27 PHP = 8,000 VND 
2022 | 1 USD = 58 PHP = 24,000 VND | 1 USD = 38 PHP = 12,000 VND 
Difference | 18 Pesos, 5000 VND | **11 Pesos, 4000 VND**


</small>
 -->
<!-- Range | 45% Philippines, 26% Vietnam  | 41% Philippines, 50% Vietnam -->

<h4 style="color: darkcyan">The Banks Earn from the Spread of the Clearing Funds</h4>

<small>
Assuming:

- RCBC sets up a coconut fund that will earn 5% annually
- A coconut exporter needs 100k pesos to export to Japan DDP
- It gets 100k pesos from the fund, while its Japanese buyer pays 107k pesos equivalent value in yen
- Bank of Mitsubishi gets the yen payment and earns 2% spread which includes insurance risk
- RCBC earns when the Philippines imports from overseas

Trade is sped up at minimal cost.

<h4 style="color: darkcyan;">Pool Clearing is an Expansion of the Pantrypoints system</h4>

<small>
The Pantrypoints system is designed to save cash which can then be used to spur world trade, via Pool Clearing, in order to get rid of stagflation.
</small>


<iframe src="/importpoolfull.mp4" style="border:0; margin: 30px 0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>

<!-- ## Planned Overseas Expansion

- **Vietnam**: We started testing our system in Vietnam in 2016. This is our solution to the invasion of saltwater and other problems in the Mekong
- **Spain**: There is a Filipino community in the Basque region that is interested in our moneyless system.
